# Chicago

Insurance companies are interested in reducing the amount of accidents as this decreases cost. We offer them a solution which warns a driver before entering a ‘dangerous zone’. The driver increases their attention and therefore, decreases the amount of accidents. The danger-level of a zone is determined by our model. We base this model on police report data which provides several environmental variables.

The goal of this project is to predict the areas of the city of Chicago where the risk of accidents is greatest. The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of accidents in the city by informing drivers when they enter a high-risk area. 

This project brings together all the key stages of a data scientist's work: from data cleansing, to data mining, to visualization and machine learning.
